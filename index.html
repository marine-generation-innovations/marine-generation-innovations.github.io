        <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
        <p>
        Marine Generation Innovations, LLC is a high tech electrical 
        manufacturing company targeting the renewable energy generation 
        sector. Specifically, Marine Generation Innovations owns patent 
        rights in the United Kingdom for innovative, water-submerged, 
        flooded generators, for use in sea, oceans, straights, and 
        gulfs. We intend to conduct research, as well as design and 
        manufacture devices for 500kW and 1MW units to be sold within 
        the UK, and later abroad. As our company progresses and 
        enhances its reputation, we plan to develop higher capacity 
        generators in a bid to exploit the ever-growing renewable 
        energy market.
        </p>

        <p>
        At Marine Generation Innovations we believe that technical 
        innovation can lead to groundbreaking efficiency improvements 
        in existing solutions, and that fully submerged generators are 
        the future of hydroelectric turbines as cost falls and human 
        interaction can be reduced as well, allowing a greater level of 
        automation.
        </p>

        <p>
        We aim to provide a clear and viable alternative to sealed 
        energy generators so that customers may make their own decision 
        about which solution is best for them, and we plan to achieve 
        this by thoroughly testing our product, and building them with 
        genuinely competitive properties, especially in terms of 
        operability, reliability, durability, and availability.
        </p>

        <p>
        We believe that the best business in this sector is the 
        reliable one with clear metrics and reliable products. By 
        providing efficient tools that behave exactly as advertised, we 
        feel that we can build a good relationship with our customers, 
        thus producing industry-leading products this year and in each 
        year following.
        </p>

        <p>
        Fully submerged, flooded generators are designed to withstand 
        great environmental hazards so that they may last longer 
        without human intervention. Maintenance cost reduction is 
        useful for everyone, but we plan to analyze our customer needs 
        to more accurately select those who can benefit from 
        maintenance cost improvements.
        </p>

        <p>
        Renewable energy generation is unmistakably the most important
        urban issue of our decade, and not a fad that will dwindle into 
        obsolescence. The UK government cites that wave and tidal 
        energy have the potential to meet a fifth of its sum energy 
        demand today, and our technology addresses this market by 
        improving on existing generators. By improving generators 
        potentially used in such an industry, we identify hundreds of 
        potential customers and millions in potential profit. Another 
        major advantage is that existing sealed-style turbines have 
        foreseeable obsolescence - they have a limited lifetime and 
        require human intervention for replacement and repair. We 
        believe that in this highly competitive market, businesses will 
        be considering generator alternatives each year.
        </p>

        <p>
        One advantage we have in being undergraduate university 
        students is that we're well acquainted with bleeding edge 
        research in various subjects, and have very widespread academic 
        knowledge, including renewable energy and electrical 
        engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
        We believe that we can secure a major primary investment from a 
        venture capital group due to the reliability of our business 
        plan, and turn a profit without needing any further investment. 
        Because of this, we believe a limited liability corporation is 
        the ideal choice for us, providing some protection for 
        investors and ourselves, without being forced to pay major 
        taxes related to risk. We also have no interest at this time in 
        an initial public offering.
        </p>

        <h2 id="products">Our Products</h2>
        <p>
        MGI is a sea-immersed direct-drive permanent magnet AC 
        generator. Marine Generation Innovations, LLC offers MGI with a 
        range of 500kW (MGI-500) and 1MW (MGI-1000) rated models suited 
        for different tidal, barrage and wave energy applications 
        across the UK. We are capable of custom design of the outer 
        casing in order to ensure perfect fit with any type of stand. 
        Our services include production, startup of completed system, 
        remote servicing and maintenance as well as expertise 
        throughout the operation period of our products. If requested 
        by the customer we will organise subcontractors for providing 
        other needed parts and components, transport, installation at 
        site and connection to the grid.
        </p>

        <p>
        Thanks to innovative technological solutions used in the MGI 
        Product line, the generators have improved operability (4.8%), 
        reliability (10%), survivability (2.6%) and availability (5%) 
        comparing to currently existing technology. It is all due to 
        our unique flooded design which significantly improves 
        cooling of coils and other components of the generator. It 
        removes the danger of seal wear-off or damage which is a great 
        threat to generator's operation in conventional technologies; 
        removes the need for pressurised oil in the system which is a 
        source of potential spillage and water pollution in case of 
        seal fault and therefore makes our product environment 
        friendly.
