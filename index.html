                <h2 id="about">About Us</h2>
                <p>
                Marine Generation Innovations, LLC is a high tech electrical 
                manufacturing company targeting the renewable energy generation 
                sector. Specifically, Marine Generation Innovations owns patent 
                rights in the United Kingdom for innovative, water-submerged, 
                flooded generators, for use in sea, oceans, straights, and 
                gulfs. We intend to conduct research, as well as design and 
                manufacture devices for 500kW and 1MW units to be sold within 
                the UK, and later abroad. As our company progresses and 
                enhances its reputation, we plan to develop higher capacity 
                generators in a bid to exploit the ever-growing renewable 
                energy market.
                </p>

                <p>
                At Marine Generation Innovations we believe that technical 
                innovation can lead to groundbreaking efficiency improvements 
                in existing solutions, and that fully submerged generators are 
                the future of hydroelectric turbines as cost falls and human 
                interaction can be reduced as well, allowing a greater level of 
                automation.
                </p>

                <p>
                We aim to provide a clear and viable alternative to sealed 
                energy generators so that customers may make their own decision 
                about which solution is best for them, and we plan to achieve 
                this by thoroughly testing our product, and building them with 
                genuinely competitive properties, especially in terms of 
                operability, reliability, durability, and availability.
                </p>

                <p>
                We believe that the best business in this sector is the 
                reliable one with clear metrics and reliable products. By 
                providing efficient tools that behave exactly as advertised, we 
                feel that we can build a good relationship with our customers, 
                thus producing industry-leading products this year and in each 
                year following.
                </p>

                <p>
                Fully submerged, flooded generators are designed to withstand 
                great environmental hazards so that they may last longer 
                without human intervention. Maintenance cost reduction is 
                useful for everyone, but we plan to analyze our customer needs 
                to more accurately select those who can benefit from 
                maintenance cost improvements.
                </p>

                <p>
                Renewable energy generation is unmistakably the most important
                urban issue of our decade, and not a fad that will dwindle into 
                obsolescence. The UK government cites that wave and tidal 
                energy have the potential to meet a fifth of its sum energy 
                demand today, and our technology addresses this market by 
                improving on existing generators. By improving generators 
                potentially used in such an industry, we identify hundreds of 
                potential customers and millions in potential profit. Another 
                major advantage is that existing sealed-style turbines have 
                foreseeable obsolescence - they have a limited lifetime and 
                require human intervention for replacement and repair. We 
                believe that in this highly competitive market, businesses will 
                be considering generator alternatives each year.
                </p>

                <p>
                One advantage we have in being undergraduate university 
                students is that we're well acquainted with bleeding edge 
                research in various subjects, and have very widespread academic 
                knowledge, including renewable energy and electrical 
                engineering.
                </p>

                <p>
                We believe that we can secure a major primary investment from a 
                venture capital group due to the reliability of our business 
                plan, and turn a profit without needing any further investment. 
                Because of this, we believe a limited liability corporation is 
                the ideal choice for us, providing some protection for 
                investors and ourselves, without being forced to pay major 
                taxes related to risk. We also have no interest at this time in 
                an initial public offering.
                </p>

                <h2 id="products">Our Products</h2>
                <p>
                MGI is a sea-immersed direct-drive permanent magnet AC 
                generator. Marine Generation Innovations, LLC offers MGI with a 
                range of 500kW (MGI-500) and 1MW (MGI-1000) rated models suited 
                for different tidal, barrage and wave energy applications 
                across the UK. We are capable of custom design of the outer 
                casing in order to ensure perfect fit with any type of stand. 
                Our services include production, startup of completed system, 
                remote servicing and maintenance as well as expertise 
                throughout the operation period of our products. If requested 
                by the customer we will organise subcontractors for providing 
                other needed parts and components, transport, installation at 
                site and connection to the grid.
                </p>

                <p>
                Thanks to innovative technological solutions used in the MGI 
                Product line, the generators have improved operability (4.8%), 
                reliability (10%), survivability (2.6%) and availability (5%) 
                comparing to currently existing technology. It is all due to 
                our unique flooded design which significantly improves 
                cooling of coils and other components of the generator. It 
                removes the danger of seal wear-off or damage which is a great 
                threat to generator's operation in conventional technologies; 
                removes the need for pressurised oil in the system which is a 
                source of potential spillage and water pollution in case of 
                seal fault and therefore makes our product environment 
                friendly.
